# Firebase Web Codelab: FriendlyChat

This repository was created for the Firebase Web Codelab session I held at the GDGIbadan I/O Extended event on the 10th of June 2017.

### Modifications
 - I deleted the Codelab folders for other tracks - Android, Cloud functions & iOS.
 - I added new folders, representing the different stages between start and finish
 
 
 The rest is left untouched from the [firebase/friendlychat](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat) repository.
